        'Rachel: Chloe, I owe you an apology.'
        '\nChloe: Hey, we were both kind of the queen of shitty.'
        "\nRachel: No, I mean it. Whatever's going on between us is, it's... intense, and new, and awesome, and... You had the courage to tell me that you feel it, too. And I treated you like shit."
        "\nChloe: Courage? I don't know if I'd call it that. More like blind desperation. And maybe a slight buzz from that wine."
        "\nRachel: I just want you to know... I'm lucky that you were with me today. You're a badass, Chloe Price.",

        "\nChloe: Is that the official Arcadia Bay DA's opinion? Accomplice it is.",

        "Chloe: When you think about it, getting suspended from the play is a good thing. You don't have to wear that silly costume and prance around stage like an idiot."
        '\nRachel: Maybe I like prancing around stage like an idiot.',

        'Rachel: Hey, I was thinking that after the show, maybe we could go do something. Just you and me.'

        "\nChloe: But... thou assured my freedom... didn't thou?"
        "\nRachel: I never said dearly I hold thee; my habit's been to keep my soul well-draped. Most loyal spirit... companion and friend... Is acting in my service not replete with excitement, amusement, and delight?"
        '\nChloe: Of course, mistress... most truly it is so.'
        '\nRachel: Then why, I pray you, wish you to be free?'
        "\nChloe: Excitement's... a mere... counterfeit of bliss. These storms and these adventures? I prefer... To know... thou still cared for my... plainest self. "
        '\nRachel: I have thee in my grasp; I will not bend. I will not see thee flying forth alone! The envy would be more than I could bear.'
        "\nChloe: So come with me! Is that not in thy pow'r?"
        "\nRachel: Spirit, take my hands, most faithful friend. For but a little longer I beseech: continue in thy service to my schemes. And when they are complete, I swear to thee-- We shall fly beyond this isle -- the corners of the world our mere prologue.

        '\nRachel: You tell me. What uniquely twisted location does Chloe Price plus Rachel Amber equal?'
        "\nChloe: Hmm.... Why don't you show me LA?"
        '\nRachel: Perfect. Sixty degrees every night. You and me on the Santa Monica pier, gorging on food truck food, smoking up, looking at the moon shining on the waves. And a beautiful blond man will sit next to us and smile at you.'
        '\nChloe: Yeah, okay.'
        "\nRachel: He'll say, \"I like your eyes,\" and I'll say, \"Back off, she's with me.\""

        '\nChloe: Why?'
        "\nRachel: They remind us there's so much beauty out there, which we almost never see."
        "\nChloe: Because we're blinded by what's in front of us."
        "\nRachel: Exactly. But then I learned the truth. The stars we're seeing have already been dead for millions of years. They're all... lies."
        "\nChloe: But that doesn't make them any less beautiful, right?"
        "\nRachel: I don't know. If they're not even real, then what's the point?",

        "Rachel: I think you're the only one in the world I can trust."
        "\nChloe: I'll take it, even if it's only by process of elimination."
        '\nRachel: Good.',

        "Chloe: After my dad died, I was worried I wouldn't know how to talk to him anymore. But somehow, when we speak, I always know what to say."
        '\nRachel: When you speak?'
        "\nChloe: In my dreams. He's there, and it's so real. It's almost like it's another part of my life. It used to be the only part that mattered. I've never told anyone about that. Weird, huh? Uh, Rachel?"
        "\nRachel: I was just thinking. Maybe I was wrong before. Who cares if the stars are dead. As long as we can still see them, that means they're real to us. Right?"
        '\nChloe: Right.',

        "Rachel: Thank you for being there for me last night. I'm feeling a lot better."
        '\nChloe: guess what'
        "\nRachel: hmm. I'm a good kisser?"
        "\nChloe: okay that. also we're meeting Frank at the junkyard in 2 hrs. i think he can get us in touch with Sera."

        "\nChloe: You were so fierce, and I just froze. I fucked it up, and I'm so sorry, and..."
        '\nRachel: And you saved my life. You. Saved. My. Life.'
